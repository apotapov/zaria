# Preamble

This is a [fork](https://code.google.com/p/artemis-framework/) of [Artemis Entity System Framework](http://gamadu.com/artemis/).
The major difference is that the code base has been refactored to use libgdx containers and pooling.
The hope is to eventually add it to libgdx extensions.

# What's changed

 - The packages have been renamed to follow the libgdx standard.
 - Most private fields and methods have been changed to protected to allow for easier extension.
 - Component is now an interface.
 - ComponentType has been removed. The indexing done in the ComponentManager.
 - Bag and ImmutableBag have been removed, in favor of a slightly modified com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Array.
 - HashMaps have been replaced by com.badlogic.gdx.utils.ObjectMap. ObjectIntMap and IntArray are used where appropriate.
 - Starting to add more Javadoc to classes.
 - No more classes instantiated every time World.process is run.
 - IdentifierPool has been moved to a separate class.
 - Removed all the unused utils classes.
 - Added a check to EntitySystem to prune activeEntities before processing. (in case of removal by a different system earlier on in the process cycle)
 - Cleaned up some compiler warnings.

# What's left to be done

 - This is still very much a work in progress. Feedback is appreciated. Pull requests accepted.
 - Get rid of the SafeArray class. (needed because of the difference between Bag and Array get/set implementation)
 - Javadoc the rest of the classes.
 - Do some profiling to determine bottle necks.
